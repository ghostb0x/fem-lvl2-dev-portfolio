# Developer Portfolio Page - Design from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) 

This is a portfolio page for a fake developer.

The designs were obtained from FrontednMentor.io via a figma design file for mobile, tablet, and desktop styles.

You can see the comparison between my work and the original on [my Frontend Mentor solution page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-portfolio-page-built-with-react-and-styledcomponents-D5DK_07BGM).

Note - I definitely did use this as a starting point for designing my own portfolio, hence certain similarities ðŸ¤­
