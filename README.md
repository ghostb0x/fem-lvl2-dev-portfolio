# Developer Portfolio Page - Design from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) 

This is a portfolio page for a fake developer.

The designs were obtained from FrontednMentor.io via a figma design file for mobile, tablet, and desktop styles.

You can see the comparison between my work and the original on [my Frontend Mentor solution page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-portfolio-page-built-with-react-and-styledcomponents-D5DK_07BGM).

Note - I definitely did use this as a starting point for designing my own portfolio, hence certain similarities ðŸ¤­.

## Built with React and styled-components

I built this page using React and styled-components because I have a good starting boilerplate template that combines Create React App defaults with various other npm packages (like styled-components and Josh Comeau's opinionated new-component package).
